# Stage 4 - PL/pgSQL Main Programs

This README details the implementation and execution of the two main programs (`main_program_1.sql` and `main_program_2.sql`) for the dormitory management system. For each program, we provide a verbal description, the code, execution with screenshots showing outputs and database updates, and a short narrative illustrating its use case and purpose. Additionally, a one-sentence explanation is provided for each trigger, function, and procedure.


## Triggers

-   **log_changes**: Logs INSERT/UPDATE operations on `lease`, `rental`, and `maintenance_request` tables to the `change_log` table for keeping history  - archive purposes.
-   **check_max_apartments**: Prevents inserting apartments into a building if the count exceeds the `MaxApartments` limit defined in the `Building` table.
-   **check_max_rooms**: Ensures the number of rooms in an apartment does not exceed the `MaxRooms` limit specified in the `Apartment` table.
-   **check_max_people**: Blocks rental insertions if the number of students in a room exceeds the `MaxPeople` limit defined in the `Room` table.


## Functions

-   **calculate_annual_revenue_and_discounts**: Calculates total revenue and discount costs for leases in a specified academic year based on a fixed rental cost.
-   **employee_attendance_summary**: Returns a refcursor with attendance details for an employee in a given month and year, updating incomplete records.
-   **count_maintenance_by_priority**: Summarizes maintenance requests by priority to provide workload insights.
-   **employee_attendance_violations**: Identifies employees who failed to log attendance on a specific date via a refcursor.
-   **student_rental_history**: Retrieves a student’s rental history (lease ID, room ID, check-in, and check-out dates) using a refcursor, validating date consistency.


## Procedures

-   **reassign_leases_to_manager**: Updates the `managerid` field in the `lease` table to transfer leases from one manager to another.
-   **assign_rooms_to_students**: Creates a new lease and rental record to assign a room to a student with a randomly selected manager.
-   **extend_contract_period**: Extends the end date of contracts nearing expiration by a specified number of months.
-   **process_pending_leave_requests**: Approves or rejects pending leave requests for managers based on their recent attendance records.
-   **archive_old_rentals**: Moves rental records older than two years to the `rental_archive` table and deletes them from the `rental` table.
-   **assign_maintenance_to_team**: Assigns unresolved maintenance requests to an employee in a specified department.


## Main Program 1

### Description

**Main Program 1** automates financial and administrative tasks in the dormitory management system. It calls three functions and three procedures:

-   **Functions**:
    -   `calculate_annual_revenue_and_discounts`: Computes revenue and discount costs for the 2025 academic year.
    -   `employee_attendance_summary`: Retrieves and updates attendance for employee ID 1 in June 2025.
    -   `count_maintenance_by_priority`: Summarizes maintenance requests by priority.
-   **Procedures**:
    -   `reassign_leases_to_manager`: Transfers leases from manager ID 1 to ID 2.
    -   `assign_rooms_to_students`: Assigns room ID 4 to student ID 1.
    -   `extend_contract_period`: Extends contracts by 12 months.

The program uses exception handling to log errors and `RAISE NOTICE` for feedback. It updates the `lease`, `rental`, `attendance_log`, and `contract` tables, with changes logged in `change_log` via triggers.

-   **Database Updates**:
    -   `lease`: Updated `managerid` to 2.
    -   `rental`: NOT Added a record for student ID 1, room ID 4 - Because of trigger restrictions - OK!
    -   `attendance_log`: Updated `check_out_time` for employee ID 1.
    -   `contract`: Extended `end_date` by 12 months.
    -   `change_log`: Logged INSERT/UPDATE operations.
-   **Verification**: queries confirmed updates; no exceptions were raised.

### Narrative

Sarah, a dormitory manager, runs `Main Program 1` to prepare for a financial audit. She needs to calculate 2025 revenue, ensure staff attendance is accurate for payroll, assess maintenance needs, reassign leases due to a manager’s retirement, assign a new student to a room, and extend contracts to avoid disruptions. The program automates these tasks, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.

## Main Program 2

### Description

**Main Program 2** focuses on student and employee management, calling two functions and three procedures:

-   **Functions**:
    -   `student_rental_history`: Retrieves rental history for student ID 1.
    -   `employee_attendance_violations`: Identifies employees missing attendance logs on the current date.
-   **Procedures**:
    -   `process_pending_leave_requests`: Approves/rejects leave requests based on attendance.
    -   `archive_old_rentals`: Archives rentals older than two years to `rental_archive` and deletes them from `rental`.
    -   `assign_maintenance_to_team`: Assigns unresolved maintenance requests to an employee in department ID 1.

The program uses refcursors, exception handling, and `RAISE NOTICE` for feedback. It updates the `leave_requests`, `rental`, `rental_archive`, and `maintenance_request` tables, with changes logged in `change_log`.

### Narrative

Alex, a dormitory administrator, runs `Main Program 2` to address a student’s complaint about their room assignment and prepare for the new term. He retrieves the student’s rental history to resolve the issue, checks staff attendance compliance, processes leave requests to plan staffing, archives old rentals to optimize the database, and assigns maintenance tasks to ensure the dormitory is ready, all with minimal manual effort.
