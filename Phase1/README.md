## Overview
This README documents Phase 3 of the university dormitory management system integration project, focusing on merging the new department's database with our existing system. David, the university manager, required a unified database to manage managers, student leases, and rentals effectively. This phase involved importing foreign schemas, modifying tables, creating views, running queries, and ensuring data integrity through backups. All changes were planned to support David's goal of streamlined operations across the university's dormitory and HR systems.

## Integration Decisions and Rationale
We decided to define dorm managers as inheriting from employees, meaning they inherit attributes like names from the `employee_local` table. This decision was made to reduce redundancy and ensure consistency between the HR and dormitory systems. Since managers are a subset of employees, their details (e.g., name) should be sourced from a single table (`employee_local`), avoiding duplicate data entry and potential inconsistencies. This inheritance model also simplified joins in views and queries, making it easier for David to manage and analyze manager-related data across departments.

## Summary of Changes
- **Removed Redundant Columns**: Dropped the `fullname` column from `dorm_management` since managers inherit names from `employee_local`.
- **Updated Data**: Standardized manager emails in `dorm_management` using employee names from `employee_local`.
- **Corrected Errors**: Swapped `name` and `location` in `department_local` to fix a data mismatch in the received database.
- **Imported and Localized Tables**: Copied remote tables (e.g., `_remote`) to local tables (e.g., `_local`) to apply constraints.
- **Added Constraints**: Implemented primary keys, foreign keys, and NOT NULL constraints to ensure data integrity.
- **Added New Positions**: Inserted two new positions (`Unpaid Leave`, `Subject to Termination`) to resolve missing foreign key references.
- **Created Views and Queries**: Developed views to integrate HR and dormitory data, along with queries to provide actionable insights.

**Rationale**: These changes aimed to create a unified, consistent database by eliminating redundancy, correcting errors, and enforcing data integrity. Localizing tables enabled constraint application, while views and queries provided David with tools to monitor and manage operations effectively.

### Detailed Integration Decisions
- **Manager Inheritance**: Defined dorm managers as inheriting from employees, removing the `fullname` column from `dorm_management` to avoid redundancy.
- **Foreign Schema Import**: Imported remote tables using:  
  ```sql
  IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA public
  FROM SERVER otherdatabase_server
  INTO public;
  ```
- **Email Standardization**: Updated manager emails in `dorm_management` to `first.last@staff.university.ac.il` based on `employee_local` names.
- **Data Correction**: Swapped `name` and `location` in `department_local` to correct a mismatch.
- **Table Localization**: Copied remote tables to local ones (e.g., `employee_remote` to `employee_local`) for constraint application.
- **Constraints**: Added primary keys (e.g., `pk_employee` on `emp_id`), foreign keys (e.g., `fk_contract_employee`), and NOT NULL constraints.
- **New Positions**: Added `Unpaid Leave` (position_id 0) and `Subject to Termination` (position_id -1) to `position_local` to resolve foreign key issues.

### Process and SQL Commands Explanation
The integration process involved several steps:
1. **Schema Import**: Imported foreign tables to access the new departmentâ€™s data using the `IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA` command.
2. **Data Cleanup**: Removed redundant columns (e.g., `fullname`) and corrected data mismatches (e.g., `department_local` swap).
3. **Table Localization**: Created local copies of remote tables to apply constraints locally.
4. **Constraint Enforcement**: Added primary and foreign keys to maintain data relationships.
5. **Testing**: Inserted test data (e.g., manager ID 450) to verify constraints.
6. **Views and Queries**: Created views to integrate data and queries to provide insights for David.

The SQL scripts are available for review:
- [Integrate.sql](Integrate.sql): Contains commands for table creation, modification, and constraints.
- [Views.sql](Views.sql): Includes view creation and associated queries.

### Views Description and Data Retrieval
#### View 1: ManagerEmployeeContractProfile
- **Description**: Integrates data from `employee_local`, `dorm_management`, and `contract_local` to provide a comprehensive profile of managers, including employee details, dorm management info, and contract details.  
  ![View 1 Diagram](images/VIEW1.png)
- **Data Retrieval**:  
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM public.ManagerEmployeeContractProfile LIMIT 10;
  ```

#### View 2: RentalLeaseEmployeeContract
- **Description**: Connects rental and lease data from the dormitory system with employee contract details, focusing on managers overseeing student leases, including rental details, lease terms, and contract information.
