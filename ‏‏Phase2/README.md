## Introduction
A new manager, David, recently took over the university dormitory system, and he quickly noticed that things were a bit of a mess. The database was full of outdated records, some students were causing headaches with endless maintenance requests, and there were even empty apartments and buildings that no one had bothered to clean up. On top of that, different departments kept coming to him with urgent requests: the maintenance team needed to know which buildings had the most issues, the finance team wanted to check on lease discounts, and the marketing team was asking for data to make a promotional video. David knew he had to get the database in order and provide the information everyone needed.

To start, David made sure to back up the database before making any changes. On April 23, 2025, he created a backup called `backup23_04_2025` after adding more data to the system, preparing it for the complex tasks ahead. Then, he and his team got to work: they wrote queries to find specific information, updated records to improve the dorms, removed outdated or problematic entries, and added rules to prevent future errors. After finishing all the changes, David created a final backup on April 24, 2025, named `Backup__2__24_04_2025`, so they could always go back to the updated database if needed.

This report shows everything Davidâ€™s team did in Phase 2: the queries they ran to find information, the updates and deletions they made to fix the database, the rules they added to keep things in check, and how they tested changes to make sure everything worked smoothly.

## Constraints

### Constraint 1: Check on DiscountPercent in Lease Table
**Story**: The finance team noticed inconsistencies in lease discounts, with some entries exceeding reasonable limits. To prevent future errors, they decided to enforce a constraint ensuring that the `DiscountPercent` in the `Lease` table stays within a valid range (0 to 100).

This constraint ensures that the `DiscountPercent` in the `Lease` table is between 0 and 100.

- **ALTER TABLE Command**:  
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE Lease
  ADD CONSTRAINT check_discountpercent_range
  CHECK (DiscountPercent >= 0 AND DiscountPercent <= 100);
  ```
- **Violation Test (Setting DiscountPercent to 300)**:  
  ![Constraint 1 Violation](./images/V1.png)

### Constraint 2: NOT NULL and CHECK on PhoneNumber in Student Table
**Story**: The administration office found that some student records were missing phone numbers or had incorrect formats, making communication difficult. They decided to enforce a constraint requiring a valid phone number in the format `+972 5X-XXX-XXXX` and ensuring it is never null.

This constraint ensures that the `PhoneNumber` in the `Student` table is not null and follows the format `+972 5X-XXX-XXXX`.

- **ALTER TABLE Commands**:  
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE Student
  ALTER COLUMN PhoneNumber SET NOT NULL;

  ALTER TABLE Student
  ADD CONSTRAINT check_student_phonenumber
  CHECK (PhoneNumber ~ '^\+972 5[0-9]-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}$');
  ```
- **Violation Test 1 (Invalid PhoneNumber Format)**:  
  ![Constraint 2 Violation 1](./images/V2.png)
- **Violation Test 2 (NULL PhoneNumber)**:  
  ![Constraint 2 Violation 2](./images/V3.png)

### Constraint 3: NOT NULL and CHECK on CheckOutDate in Rental Table
**Story**: The housing office encountered issues with rental records where the checkout date was missing or earlier than the check-in date, causing scheduling conflicts. They decided to enforce a constraint ensuring that `CheckOutDate` is not null and is always after `CheckInDate`.

This constraint ensures that the `CheckOutDate` in the `Rental` table is not null and is after the `CheckInDate`.

- **ALTER TABLE Commands**:  
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE Rental
  ALTER COLUMN CheckOutDate SET NOT NULL;

  ALTER TABLE Rental
  ADD CONSTRAINT check_checkout_after_checkin
  CHECK (CheckOutDate > CheckInDate);
  ```
- **Violation Test 1 (CheckOutDate Before CheckInDate)**:  
  ![Constraint 3 Violation 1](./images/V4.png)
- **Violation Test 2 (NULL CheckOutDate)**:  
  ![Constraint 3 Violation 2](./images/V5.png)

## Transaction Management (Rollback and Commit)

This section demonstrates the use of transactions to manage updates in the database, ensuring data integrity through rollback and commit operations. Each step is executed and captured to show the state of the database throughout the process.

### Update with ROLLBACK
**Story**: The finance team wanted to test a potential discount increase for a specific lease (LeaseID = 400) by adding 5% to the `DiscountPercent`. However, they were unsure if the change would be appropriate for the budget. They decided to perform the update within a transaction, check the result, and then roll it back to evaluate the impact without making permanent changes.

This demonstrates an update to the `Lease` table with a rollback, showing the database state at each step:

- **Step 1: Initial State (Before Update)**:  
  The initial state of the `Lease` table for LeaseID 400 is shown before any changes are made. The query `SELECT LeaseID, DiscountPercent FROM Lease WHERE LeaseID = 400;` is executed.  
  ![Rollback Step 1 - Initial State](./images/R1.png)

- **Step 2: Start Transaction**:  
  A transaction is started with the `BEGIN;` 
  ![Rollback Step 2 - Begin Transaction](./images/R2.png)

- **Step 3: Update DiscountPercent**:  
  The update is applied with the query `UPDATE Lease SET DiscountPercent = DiscountPercent + 5 WHERE LeaseID = 400;`, increasing the `DiscountPercent` by 5 for LeaseID 400.  
  ![Rollback Step 3 - Update](./images/R3.png)

- **Step 4: State After Update (Before Rollback)**:  
  The state of the `Lease` table is checked after the update but before the rollback, using `SELECT LeaseID, DiscountPercent FROM Lease WHERE LeaseID = 400;`. The `DiscountPercent` reflects the temporary increase.  
  ![Rollback Step 4 - After Update](./images/R4.png)

- **Step 5: Rollback the Transaction**:  
  The transaction is rolled back with the `ROLLBACK;` reverting all changes made within the transaction.  
  ![Rollback Step 5 - Rollback](./images/R5.png)

- **Step 6: State After Rollback (Returns to Initial State)**:  
  The final state of the `Lease` table is checked after the rollback, using `SELECT LeaseID, DiscountPercent FROM Lease WHERE LeaseID = 400;`. The `DiscountPercent` has returned to its original value, confirming the rollback was successful.  
  ![Rollback Step 6 - After Rollback](./images/R6.png)

### Update with COMMIT
**Story**: Following a room renovation, the housing office decided to permanently increase the maximum number of occupants for a specific room (RoomID = 400) by 1, changing the `MaxPeople` (also referred to as `MaxOccupants` in the database) from 3 to 4. They performed the update within a transaction and committed it to ensure the change is saved, confirming the update's success. Afterward, they attempted a rollback to verify that the change was indeed permanent.

This demonstrates an update to the `Room` table with a commit, showing the database state at each step:

- **Step 1: Initial State (Before Update)**:  
  The initial state of the `Room` table for RoomID 400 is shown, with `MaxPeople` set to 3 before any changes are made. The query `SELECT RoomID, MaxPeople FROM Room WHERE RoomID = 400;` is executed.  
  ![Commit Step 1 - Initial State](./images/C1.png)

- **Step 2: Start Transaction**:  
  A transaction is started with the `BEGIN;` 
  ![Commit Step 2 - Begin Transaction](./images/C2.png)

- **Step 3: Update MaxPeople**:  
  The update is applied with the query `UPDATE Room SET MaxPeople = MaxPeople + 1 WHERE RoomID = 400;`, increasing the `MaxPeople` by 1 for RoomID 400 (from 3 to 4).  
  ![Commit Step 3 - Update](./images/C3.png)

- **Step 4: State After Update (Before Commit)**:  
  The state of the `Room` table is checked after the update but before the commit, using `SELECT RoomID, MaxPeople FROM Room WHERE RoomID = 400;`. The `MaxPeople` reflects the temporary increase to 4.  
  ![Commit Step 4 - After Update](./images/C4.png)

- **Step 5: Commit the Transaction**:  
  The transaction is committed with the `COMMIT;` command, making the update permanent.  
  ![Commit Step 5 - Commit](./images/C5.png)

- **Step 6: State After Commit (Change is Permanent)**:  
  The state of the `Room` table is checked after the commit, using `SELECT RoomID, MaxPeople FROM Room WHERE RoomID = 400;`. The `MaxPeople` remains 4, confirming the update was successfully committed.  
  ![Commit Step 6 - After Commit](./images/C6.png)

- **Step 7: Attempt to Rollback After Commit (No Effect)**:  
  An attempt to rollback is made with the `ROLLBACK;` command after the commit. Since the transaction was already committed, this action has no effect, and the `MaxPeople` remains 4.  
  ![Commit Step 7 - Rollback Attempt](./images/C7.png)
